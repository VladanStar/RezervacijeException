# ReservationsException
Make a hierarchy of exceptions related to entering airline ticket reservations. Each reservation has the name and surname of the person making the reservation, the date and time of departure and the destination to which the user goes. If it happens that the entered date has more or less than 6 digits and two dashes, the DateNot ValidException should happen. If the username does not have at least 2 characters, NameNotValidException should occur. All Reservation-related Exceptions should inherit the ReservationException. Test the operation of exceptions through the startup class
